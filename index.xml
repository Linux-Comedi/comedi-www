<title>Comedi - Control and Measurement Interface</title>
<body>


<h1>Introduction</h1>

<p>
The Comedi project develops open-source drivers, tools, and libraries
for data acquisition.
</p>

<p>
<b>Comedi</b> is a collection of drivers for a variety of common
data acquisition plug-in boards.  The drivers are implemented as
a core Linux kernel module providing common functionality and
individual low-level driver modules.
</p>

<p>
<b>Comedilib</b> is a user-space library that provides a
developer-friendly interface to Comedi devices.  Included in the
Comedilib distribution is documentation, configuration and
calibration utilities, and demonstration programs.
</p>

<p>
<b>Kcomedilib</b> is a Linux kernel module (distributed with Comedi)
that provides the same interface as Comedilib in kernel space,
suitable for real-time tasks.  It is effectively a "kernel library"
for using Comedi from real-time tasks.
</p>


<h1>Features</h1>

<ul>
<li>Integrated real-time support for most hardware</li>
<li>High-level library (comedilib)</li>
<li>Application-level device independence</li>
<li>Requires a Linux 2.6 kernel.</li>
</ul>


<h1>Latest version</h1>

<ul>
<li>comedi-0.7.76, released 2008-01-28</li>
<li>comedilib-0.10.2, released 2014-04-15</li>
<li>comedi_calibrate-3, released 2014-12-16</li>
</ul>

<p>
Comedi and Comedilib are being actively developed, and because of this,
new versions are sometimes buggy.  However, reported bugs are usually
quickly fixed.
</p>

<h1>Maintainers</h1>

<ul>
	<li>Frank Mori Hess <em>&lt;fmhess@users.sourceforge.net&gt;</em></li>

<p>It is generally preferable to direct Comedi-related questions to the 
<a href="http://groups.google.com/group/comedi_list">mailing
list</a> rather than mailing the maintainers directly. 
</p>
<p>
Comedi was originally written and conceived by David Schleef <em>&lt;ds@schleef.org&gt;</em>.
Much of Comedi has been developed by others.  See the AUTHORS files in
<a href="http://comedi.org/git?p=comedi/comedi.git;a=blob_plain;f=AUTHORS;hb=HEAD">Comedi</a>
and <a href="http://comedi.org/git?p=comedi/comedilib.git;a=blob_plain;f=AUTHORS;hb=HEAD">Comedilib</a>
